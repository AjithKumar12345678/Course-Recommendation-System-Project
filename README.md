In today's world, there are so many courses available, and picking the right one can be tricky. This project introduces a Course Recommendation System (CRS) to help with that. The CRS uses smart technology to suggest personalized courses based on what people like and what they want to achieve. The main goal of the Course Recommendation System is to make it easier for people to choose the right courses. It looks at what people prefer, their school background, and what they want to do in the future. By using special computer programs, the system aims to improve people's satisfaction with their chosen courses and help them succeed. To make the Course Recommendation System work, we first ask people about their favorite subjects and how they like to leam. This information helps us create a smart system that understands what courses would be best for each person. The end result is a working Course Recommendation System prototype/application. It takes the information we gathered from people's preferences and turns it i into a helpful tool. This tool suggests courses that fit each person well. We keep improving the system by listening to what people say and testing it to make sure it stays useful for everyone in the community.
